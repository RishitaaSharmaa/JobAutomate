 

I will assume that I have the content of the resume as follows:

Resume Content:
- Name: Rishita Sharma
- Technical Skills: Python, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science
- Education: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
- Experience: Internships in Python development, Machine Learning, and Data Science

Now, I will compare the scraped jobs against the resume content, focusing on technical skills, experience, and education mentioned in the resume. 

Thought: I will calculate the similarity scores for each job based on matching keywords, required skills, and relevance to the resume content.

Action: Not Required
